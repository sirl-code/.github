# .github
Systems and Informatics Research Lab (SIRL). We develop applied AI and data-centric machine learning methods using mobile, wearable, and multimodal sensing, with a focus on health,
human behavior, and real-world systems.

## Organization Structure and Ownership
  - The GitHub organization is owned and administered by the Principal Investigator (PI).
  - Students and research staff are added as Members, not Owners.
  - Ownership and administrative privileges remain with the PI to ensure continuity, security, and long-term maintenance.

 ## Repository Structure
   - Each research paper must have a separate repository.
   - Repository names should follow the format: paper-shortname-venue-year
   - Repositories should not combine code from multiple papers.

## Minimum Repository Requirements
  Each repository must include:
  - README.md describing:
      - the associated paper,
      - project purpose,
      - repository structure,
      - instructions to reproduce results (to the extent possible).
  - Clear citation information (BibTeX or reference).
  - Scripts or instructions needed to run experiments or analyses.
  - Perfect code organization is not required, but documentation is mandatory.
## Data Handling and Ethics
 - Raw sensitive or identifiable data must not be uploaded to GitHub.
 - If data cannot be shared due to privacy or ethics constraints:
     - include a data/README.md explaining access procedures or restrictions.
 - Processed features or synthetic data may be shared only with PI approval.

## Roles and Responsibilities
 - Each repository will have one designated student maintainer (typically the first author).
 - The maintainer is responsible for:
     -   organizing the repository,
     -   ensuring documentation is complete,
     -   responding to reasonable issues or questions.
 - The PI reviews repositories at release time, not every commit.

## Branching and Contributions
 - The main branch should remain stable.
 - Experimental work should be conducted on separate branches.
 - Pull requests are encouraged for major changes but are not mandatory for early-stage work.
 - Commit messages should be descriptive but need not follow strict conventions.

## Releases and Publication
 - When a paper is accepted:
     - a tagged release (e.g., v1.0-venue-year) should be created,
     - The release should reference the paper and citation.
 - Repositories may be linked from the lab website and the published paper.

## Access and Membership Changes
 - Membership is granted on a project-need basis.
 - Students who leave the lab will be removed from the organization, but their contributions will remain credited through commit history.
 - This is standard professional practice and not punitive.

## Expectations and Professional Conduct
 - The GitHub organization is a professional research space.
 - Respectful communication and responsible use are expected.
 - The purpose is collaboration and dissemination, not surveillance or performance evaluation.
