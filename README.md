# .github
Systems and Informatics Research Lab (SIRL). We develop applied AI and data-centric machine learning methods using mobile, wearable, and multimodal sensing, with a focus on health,
human behavior, and real-world systems.

## Organization Structure and Ownership
  - The GitHub organization is owned and administered by the Principal Investigator (PI).
  - Students and research staff are added as Members, not Owners.
  - Ownership and administrative privileges remain with the PI to ensure continuity, security, and long-term maintenance.

 ## Repository Structure
   - Each research paper must have a separate repository.
   - Repository names should follow the format: paper-shortname-venue-year
   - Repositories should not combine code from multiple papers.

## Minimum Repository Requirements
  Each repository must include:
  - README.md describing:
      - the associated paper,
      - project purpose,
      - repository structure,
      - instructions to reproduce results (to the extent possible).
  - Clear citation information (BibTeX or reference).
  - Scripts or instructions needed to run experiments or analyses.
  - Perfect code organization is not required, but documentation is mandatory.
## Data Handling and Ethics
 - Raw sensitive or identifiable data must not be uploaded to GitHub.
 - If data cannot be shared due to privacy or ethics constraints:
     - include a data/README.md explaining access procedures or restrictions.
 - Processed features or synthetic data may be shared only with PI approval.
